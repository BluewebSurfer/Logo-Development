  "><h1>Abstract mark
</h1>
An abstract mark is a specific type of pictorial logo. Instead of being a recognizable image—like an apple or a bird—it's an abstract geometric form that represents your business
The benefit of an abstract mark is that you can inform what your company does symbolically, without depending on the cultural connections of a specific image. You can easily assign meaning and cultivate emotion around your brand through the color and form of your logo. Abstract symbols are indeed coterminal with creativity and positive thinking. This works great because it summarizes your brand message into a symbol.
